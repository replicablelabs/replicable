"""Project-wide custom exceptions.

This module centralizes domain-specific exception types so that routers and
services can raise / catch them without importing deep infrastructure errors
like ``asyncpg`` or raw SQLAlchemy exceptions.

Add new errors here rather than scattering small ``class XError(Exception):``
definitions across the codebase; this keeps the public error surface easy to
audit and map to HTTP responses.
