# replicable public entry (HTTP only)
#
# Purpose
# - Serve ACME http-01 challenges from /var/www/html
# - Redirect apex traffic to the canonical HTTPS site when HTTPS is enabled
# - Proxy normal traffic for www and fallbacks to the internal web app at web:80
# - Keep HTTP available so we can obtain certificates first. After certs are
#   issued, enable the HTTPS config (see 20-web-https.conf.template).
